This plugin adds an AJAX tag Dropdown widget to your WooCommerce shop.
== Description ==
The _Shop Ajax tags_ dropdown allows customers to sort products based on tags instead of variations. For example:
Show all products with tag "Tshirt" or show all products with tag "Jumper" and "Jersey".

This plugin still needs some development, but if you just need a basic AJAX tag widget it will do.
We hope to release and updated version in a couple of weeks which works better.

This plugin is compatible with Wordpress 4.0 and WooCommerce 2.2.0-bleeding.
